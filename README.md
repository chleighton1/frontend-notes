## CSS

### Practical responsive web design: Let the browser do the work

```
img: {
	Display: block;
	Max-width: 100%;
}
```

^^ This is a way to set images so they donâ€™t overflow and are naturally more responsive

It is also a good Idea to set min-height and max-width for elements. You can set max-width and `margin-inline: auto` to keep things centered.

Don't delcare things you do not need! Ex: `width: 100vh` `height: 100vh` (default is auto).

`flex-wrap: wrap` is useful for overflowing flex items rather than media queries

For responsive grid, you can try `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))`

#### REM vs EM

- rem is relative to the root font size, where em is relative to the parent font size

- For padding and margin, em does not reference the parent but the actual element

#### Breakpoints

- Do not use device widths, make the breakpoints for whenever the layout 'breaks'

- for a guide on widths try the following:

'''
@mixin for-phone-only {
@media (max-width: 599px) { @content; }
}
@mixin for-tablet-portrait-up {
@media (min-width: 600px) { @content; }
}
@mixin for-tablet-landscape-up {
@media (min-width: 900px) { @content; }
}
@mixin for-desktop-up {
@media (min-width: 1200px) { @content; }
}
@mixin for-big-desktop-up {
@media (min-width: 1800px) { @content; }
}
'''
